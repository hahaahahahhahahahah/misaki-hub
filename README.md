### ⚙️ architecture

- **centralized render loop** — single `RenderStepped` connection with a cached callback system instead of individual connections per feature
- **table-driven loader** — assets and folders declared as tables, downloaded with error handling and failure notifications
- **[quartz](https://github.com/notpoiu/Quartz) compatibility layer** — automatically tests and polyfills missing executor functions at startup, ensuring cross-executor support
- **executor capability validation** — checks for critical functions after quartz patching, notifies and bails cleanly if the executor is incompatible
